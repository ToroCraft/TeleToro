# TeleToro

At its core, this modâ€™s primary intention is to open up a way for players to travel large distances while still keeping balanced and interesting game play. Instead of teleporting a player from one platform to another, a new dimension called the Teletory was created. Players can use the Teletory for fast travel like the Nether but eight times faster. To maintain balance, the portal is expensive to build in the early game (costing 40 ender pearls) and once built requires enchanted armor to be used effectively.

Hints

- One meter in the Teleotory equates to sixty-four meters in the over world.
- While in the Teletory, you will be continually taking damage as if you were teleporting using ender pearls. To be able to survive in the Teletory, wear armor that helps mitigate the damage from ender pearl teleportation.
- Jumping out of the Teletory does not send you into the void and is survivable; however, it is far from a safe means of travel.
- Breaking ender blocks with a pickaxe drops a random amount of ender pearls, make sure to use a fortune or silk touch pick. Also, breaking ender blocks in the Teletory produces fewer drops.
